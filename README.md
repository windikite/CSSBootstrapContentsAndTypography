My 33rd assignment! This assignment was focused on improving css layout and typography by exploring some more of the options available via bootstrap. Since it was okay to choose a previous project and work from there, I used the last assignment and implemented various upgrades. The requirements I met for this assignments are below.

Assignment 1  
1. I applied bootstrap typography to headings and paragraphs, such as making some of the p tags leads, as well as adding strong tags, an italics tag and changing some of the font sizes. This was all done with either bootstrap or simple html.   
2. I already had a hover animation, but to keep in the theme of using bootstrap I changed the inputs to be buttons and styled them using bootstrap classes. I chose primary for the quote button, and success for the newsletter because I felt that combo would lead people to trying both forms more reliably than the inverse.  
3. I implemented some lead classes to certain p tags, and I was already using text-center classes throughout the site so there weren't any spots that needed improvement there.   
4. While some sections did already have color via bootstrap classes, I updated many of them and added some of the pre-set colors to the cards on the page. This also updated text colors as well for contrast when appropriate.  
5. I added a responsive table with alternate row colors to show how this company stacked up against its competitors. It's styled using bootstrap of course. 

Assignment 2  
1. The images on the page are responsive to different screen sizes, and now also flex-fill which has some interesting behavior that I believe adds to the design of the page. This is seen better when using a tablet. 
2. I created a grid layout for the image gallery using bootstrap's grid system. I'm still not sold on bootstrap grid compared to the default css method, but that is just because I need more practice.   
3. Finally, I modified the footer to be even more responsive using flex-fill and swapped out the social images for dedicated icons, which I also added to the header. I also added a column and row gap to improve the visual look and prevent the container shadows from occluding eachother. The footer also shows the newsletter section to be more prominent than before. This was originally unintended, but I prefer how this looks and it makes it hard to miss the newsletter sign up form.
